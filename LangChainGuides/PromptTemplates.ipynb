    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use LangChain for creating chat-based prompt templates for the GPT-like language model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing these templates allows for dynamic and flexible interactions with large language models, ensuring we can harness their full potential for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Using Prompt Templates**:\n",
    "1. *Consistency*: Same tasks can be executed across sessions with standardized prompts.\n",
    "2. *Efficiency*: Reduces the need for manually typing and formulating prompts.\n",
    "3. *Flexibility*: Easy to alter parameters to get varied responses.\n",
    "4. *Validation*: Helps in ensuring correct and expected variable inputs.\n",
    "5. *Model Agnostic*: Templates can be reused across different language models."

It was a bright summer morning when the small fishing vessel, aptly named The Serenity, set sail from the tranquil harbor of Willow Cove. The crew, consisting of Captain Jameson, his first mate, Samuel, and two deckhands, Emma and Thomas, had embarked on a routine fishing expedition. However, as the hours ticked by and the sun reached its zenith, The Serenity failed to return.\n",

Rumors swirled, ranging from pirate attacks to a freak accident. The townsfolk's imaginations ran wild, fueled by the absence of information.\n",

      "Detective Sarah Parker, a seasoned investigator known for her sharp instincts, arrived at Willow Cove in response to the mysterious disappearance. She surveyed the harbor, taking note of the distressed families and the palpable tension in the air. Determined to uncover the truth, she set off on a mission to gather clues and interrogate witnesses.\n",

      "Sarah interviewed Emma and Thomas, the only surviving members of The Serenity's crew. They spoke of a calm sea, clear skies, and an uneventful morning. However, their testimonies contained subtle inconsistencies, raising Sarah's suspicions. She sensed that they were withholding something, but she couldn't extract the truth from their guarded expressions.\n",

      "Days turned into weeks, and the investigation seemed to hit a dead end. Sarah refused to give up, meticulously revisiting the details of that fateful day. As she examined the navigational records, a peculiar entry caught her attention - Captain Jameson had plotted an unfamiliar course that deviated from their usual routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Driven by this new information, Sarah delved deeper into Captain Jameson's background. In her search, she discovered a hidden connection between him and a notorious smuggling ring operating in the area. The possibility of foul play suddenly loomed larger, and she suspected that The Serenity might have been used for illegal activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "With newfound determination, Sarah confronted Emma and Thomas once again. This time, they cracked under the pressure, confessing that they had been coerced into participating in the smuggling operation. The boat had been hijacked by the criminals, leaving them stranded on a nearby island. Fortunately, they managed to swim ashore and were rescued by a passing fishing boat.\n",

      "The mystery of The Serenity's disappearance had been unraveled, thanks to Detective Sarah Parker's unwavering determination and her ability to unearth the truth. Willow Cove could finally find solace, knowing that justice would be served, and the town could begin to heal from the ordeal that had gripped it for weeks.\n"

    "## Talk to Your Data: A Python Notebook Tutorial\n",
    "Welcome to this interactive tutorial where we'll explore how to \"talk\" to our data using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and Vector Databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through an exciting process of transforming unstructured data (a PDF document in our case) into an interactive and smart knowledge base that can answer your questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to load data from a PDF file and split it into smaller, manageable chunks.\n",
    "- Understand the concept of text embeddings and how we can utilize them to store our data in a Vector Database.\n",
    "- Discover how to ask questions and retrieve the most relevant information from your database.\n",
    "- Use a Large Language Model to generate answers based on the context we provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will experience the benefit of harnessing the power of language models and vector databases in extracting and utilizing information from large amounts of text data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach used in this tutorial can be applied to a wide range of tasks, from creating a smart Q&A system to building a personal digital assistant or even designing a conversational AI.\n",

    "### Understanding Retrieval from Vector Databases\n",
    "Vector databases work like a magical library. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask a question, the database doesn't read through all the books (or in our case, document splits). Instead, it translates your question into a special language (the embeddings) and then finds the books that speak the same language the closest.\n",
    "\n",
    "These databases use a measure of similarity, such as cosine similarity to find the most related vectors (or embeddings). In our project, `similarity_search()` does exactly this - it finds the most similar vectors (embeddings) to the query vector using cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think of vectors as arrows in space, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the vectors are close to each other, pointing in almost the same direction, the cosine of the angle between them is close to 1, meaning they're very similar. On the contrary, if the vectors point in completely different directions, the cosine is close to -1, meaning they're very dissimilar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the essence:\n",
    "- **vectors are close** (pointing in almost the same direction) -> high cosine similarity (close to 1) -> similar meaning\n",
    "- **vectors are far apart** (pointing in almost the opposite direction) -> low cosine similarity (close to -1) -> dissimilar meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how vector databases can quickly find the most related documents to your question!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Length in Large Language Models\n",
    "When a language model reads text, it has a limit to how much it can remember at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "This limit is called the \"context length\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're reading a very long story but you have a memory limit. If the story exceeds this limit, you start to forget the earlier parts as you read further. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same happens with language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the standard GPT-3.5, the context length is 4096 tokens (~3000 words). \n",
    "\n",
    "If a text exceeds this limit, the model can't remember the initial parts while processing the later parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context length matters because the quality of the response can significantly depend on the provided context. If important information is outside of the model's context length, it won't be able to reference it in its response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Databases are the modern solution for the Context Length limits\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't feed our Large Language Models with a 300-page PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Context Length is too short. The model won't \"remember\" most of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can feed our Vector Database with a 300-page PDF!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to similarity search, we can retrieve ONLY the relevant chunks from our PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we just take our query together with the chunks without exceeding the context length."
